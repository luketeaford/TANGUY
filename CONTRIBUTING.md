# Contributing to TANGUY
Thank you for your interest in contributing to TANGUY!

Please [check out the README](README.md) to understand the goals of this project. TANGUY welcomes all participants. You can expect responses to issues within a day or two.

## Reporting Bugs
Report a bug by giving the input, the expected output, and the actual output. You may optionally include a description of why you think the code would work as you describe. The best way to report a bug is to submit a failing test with this information, but opening an issue without a test is fine.

## Feature Requests
If there's a feature you want in DUSG, open a feature request. Let's make sure the feature is a good fit for this project and its goals before anyone writes any code. If you already wrote a feature without reading these guidelines, whatever, run it by me.
